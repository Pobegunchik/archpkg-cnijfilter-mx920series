==============================

Arch Linux PKGBUILD for Canon InkJet Printer Driver (MX920 Series) 

This repository includes the package definition (PKGBUILD) as well
as the most recent source files for the package, in case the .deb
downloaded the PKGBUILD uses as the source ever goes offline.

The PKGBUILD will always attempt to retrieve the latest from
Canon's support website, and will likely break if there is an
update to the package, due to md5 signature changes.
