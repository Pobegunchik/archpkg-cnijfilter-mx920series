==============================

Arch Linux PKGBUILD for Canon InkJet Printer Driver (MX920 Series) 

This repository includes the package definition (PKGBUILD) as well
as the most recent source files for the package, in case the .deb
downloaded from Canon ever goes offline.

The PKGBUILD will always attempt to retrieve the latest from Canon,
and will likely break if there is an update.
